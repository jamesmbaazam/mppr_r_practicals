We will be using the `{deSolve}` package to solve the model equations. The `{deSolve}` package is a powerful and flexible package for solving differential equations in R. It provides a wide range of solvers for different types of differential equations.

Here, we will use the `lsoda()` function from the `{deSolve}` package to solve the model equations. The `lsoda()` function is a wrapper for the Livermore Solver for Ordinary Differential Equations (LSODA) developed by Hindmarsh and Petzold. It is a robust and efficient solver for [stiff and non-stiff differential equations](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiff_equation>).

The `lsoda()` function takes, among others, the following arguments:

- `func`: the model function that defines the differential equations,

- `times`: the time points at which to return results,

- `y`: the initial conditions, and

- `parms`: the parameters of the model.
